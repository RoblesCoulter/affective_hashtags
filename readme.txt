[*] for further information about the information gathered from Twitter, please consult https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets

Please note that we do only add key-value pairs for geo/coordinates/place information if this information was provided by the Twitter API (i.e., missing keys signal that this information is not available for the given tweet).


SENTIMENT DATA
-------------------------------
The data regarding the hashtag's sentiment (if any could be obtained) is contained in np_cultural_sentiment.csv and is formatted as csv. The sentiment score was obtained by applying a set of well-known sentiment dictionaries. The sentiment scores are scaled between 0 and 1 (very negative to very positive). For each dictionary, we list the minimum, maximum, sum and average sentiment score across all hashtags used within every tweet (most tweets only feature a single hashtag we can assign a sentiment value to)
It contains the following information (in this particular order):
- name of the hashtag
- AFINN dictionary (min, max, sum, avg)
- Opinion Lexicon (min, max, sum, avg)
- Sentistrength Lexicon (min, max, sum, avg)
- Vader (min, max, sum, avg)
- Sentiment Hashtag Lexicon (min, max, sum, avg)


Please note that we only added hashtags for which we could obtain a sentiment value from at least one sentiment dictionary.
